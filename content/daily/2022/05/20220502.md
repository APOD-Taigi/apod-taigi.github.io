## [漢羅] A Martian Eclipse: Phobos Crosses the Sun
What's that passing in front of the Sun?>

It looks like a moon, but it can't be Earth's Moon, because it isn't round.>

It's the Martian moon Phobos.>

The featured video was taken from the surface of Mars a month ago by the Perseverance rover.>

Phobos, at 11.5 kilometers across, is 150 times smaller than Luna (our moon) in diameter, but also 50 times closer to its parent planet.>

In fact, Phobos is so close to Mars that it is expected to break up and crash into Mars within the next 50 million years.>

In the near term, the low orbit of Phobos results in more rapid solar eclipses than seen from Earth.>

The featured video is shown in real time -- the transit really took about 40 seconds,as shown.>

The videographer -- the robotic rover Perseverance (Percy) -- continues to explore Jezero Crater on Mars, searching not only for clues to the watery history of the now dry world, but evidence of ancient microbial life.>
