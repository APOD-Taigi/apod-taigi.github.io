## [漢羅] First Horizon-Scale Image of a Black Hole
What does a black hole look like?>

To find out, radio telescopes from around the Earth coordinated observations of black holes with the largest known event horizons on the sky.>

Alone, black holes are just black, but these monster attractors are known to be surrounded by glowing gas.>

The first image was released yesterday and resolved the area around the black hole at the center of galaxy M87 on a scale below that expected for its event horizon.>

Pictured, the dark central region is not the event horizon, but rather the black hole's shadow -- the central region of emitting gas darkened by the central black hole's gravity.>

The size and shape of the shadow is determined by bright gas near the event horizon, by strong gravitational lensing deflections, and by the black hole's spin.>

In resolving this black hole's shadow, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) bolstered evidence that Einstein's gravity works even in extreme regions, and gave clear evidence that M87 has a central spinning black hole of about 6 billion solar masses.>

Since releasing this featured image in 2019, the EHT has expanded to include more telescopes, observe more black holes, track polarized light,and is working to observe the immediately vicinity of the black hole in the center of our Milky Way Galaxy.>

## [English] First Horizon-Scale Image of a Black Hole
What does a black hole look like?
To find out, [radio telescopes][radio telescopes] from [around the Earth][around the Earth] coordinated observations of [black holes][black holes] with the largest known [event horizon][event horizon]s on the sky.
Alone, black holes are just [black][black], but these monster attractors are known to be surrounded by glowing gas.
The first image was released yesterday and [resolved][resolved] the area around the [black hole][black hole 1] at the center of [galaxy M87][galaxy M87 e] on a scale below that expected for its [event horizon][event horizon].
[Pictured][Pictured], the dark central region is not the event horizon, but rather the [black hole's shadow][black hole's shadow] -- the central region of emitting gas darkened by the central black hole's gravity.
The size and shape of the shadow is determined by bright gas [near the event horizon][near the event horizon], by strong [gravitational lensing deflections][gravitational lensing deflections], and by the black hole's spin.
In resolving [this black hole's shadow][this black hole's shadow], the [Event Horizon Telescope][Event Horizon Telescope] (EHT) bolstered evidence that [Einstein's gravity][Einstein's gravity] works even in [extreme regions][extreme regions], and gave [clear evidence][clear evidence] that [M87][M87] has a central spinning black hole of about 6 billion solar masses.
Since releasing this featured image in 2019, the [EHT][EHT] has expanded to include [more telescopes][more telescopes], observe [more black holes][more black holes e], track [polarized light][polarized light e],and [is working to observe][is working to observe] the immediately vicinity of the [black hole][black hole 2] in [the center][the center] of our [Milky Way Galaxy][Milky Way Galaxy].
