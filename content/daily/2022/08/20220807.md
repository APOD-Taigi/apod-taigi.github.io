## [漢羅] Meteor before Galaxy

What's that green streak in front of the Andromeda galaxy?>

A meteor.>

While photographing the Andromeda galaxy in 2016, near the peak of the Perseid Meteor Shower, a small pebble from deep space crossed right in front of our Milky Way Galaxy's far-distant companion.>

The small meteor took only a fraction of a second to pass through this 10-degree field.>

The meteor flared several times while braking violently upon entering Earth's atmosphere.>

The green color was created, at least in part, by the meteor's gas glowing as it vaporized.>

Although the exposure was timed to catch a Perseid meteor, the orientation of the imaged streak seems a better match to a meteor from the Southern Delta Aquariids, a meteor shower that peaked a few weeks earlier.>

Not coincidentally, the Perseid Meteor Shower peaks later this week, although this year the meteors will have to outshine a sky brightened by a nearly full moon.>
