## [漢羅] Portrait of the Eagle Nebula
A star cluster around 2 million years young surrounded by natal clouds of dust and glowing gas, Messier 16 (M16) is also known as The Eagle Nebula.>

This beautifully detailed image of the region adopts the colorful Hubble palette and includes cosmic sculptures made famous in Hubble Space Telescope close-ups of the starforming complex.>

Described as elephant trunks or Pillars of Creation, dense, dusty columns rising near the center are light-years in length but are gravitationally contracting to form stars.>

Energetic radiation from the cluster stars erodes material near the tips, eventually exposing the embedded new stars.>

Extending from the ridge of bright emission left of center is another dusty starforming column known as the Fairy of Eagle Nebula.>

M16 lies about 7,000 light-years away, an easy target for binoculars or small telescopes in a nebula rich part of the sky toward the split constellation Serpens Cauda (the tail of the snake).>

As framed, this telescopic portrait of the Eagle Nebula is about 70 light-years across.>
