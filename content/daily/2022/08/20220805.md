## [漢羅] A Beautiful Trifid
The beautiful Trifid Nebula is a cosmic study in contrasts.>

Also known as M20, it lies about 5,000 light-years away toward the nebula rich constellation Sagittarius.>

A star forming region in the plane of our galaxy, the Trifid does illustrate three different types of astronomical nebulae; red emission nebulae dominated by light from hydrogen atoms, blue reflection nebulae produced by dust reflecting starlight, and dark nebulae where dense dust clouds appear in silhouette.>

But the red emission region, roughly separated into three parts by obscuring dust lanes, is what lends the Trifid its popular name.>

Pillars and jets sculpted by newborn stars, above and right of the emission nebula's center, appear in famous Hubble Space Telescope close-up images of the region.>

The Trifid Nebula is about 40 light-years across.>

Too faint to be seen by the unaided eye, it almost covers the area of a full moon in planet Earth's sky.>

Open star cluster M21 just peeks into this telescopic field of view along the bottom right edge of the frame.>
