## [漢羅] Dust Clouds of the Pacman Nebula
Stars can create huge and intricate dust sculptures from the dense and dark molecular clouds from which they are born.>

The tools the stars use to carve their detailed works are high energy light and fast stellar winds.>

The heat they generate evaporates the dark molecular dust as well as causing ambient hydrogen gas to disperse and glow red.>

Pictured here, a new open cluster of stars designated IC 1590 is nearing completion around the intricate interstellar dust structures in the emission nebula NGC 281, dubbed the Pac-man Nebula because of its overall shape.>

The dust cloud on the upper left is classified as a Bok Globule as it may gravitationally collapse and form a star -- or stars.>

The Pacman Nebula lies about 10,000 light years away toward the constellation of Cassiopeia.>
