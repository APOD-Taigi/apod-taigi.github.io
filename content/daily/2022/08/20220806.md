Get out your red/blue glasses and float next to Phobos, grooved moon of Mars!>

Captured in 2004 by the High Resolution Stereo Camera on board ESA's Mars Express spacecraft, the image data was recorded at a distance of about 200 kilometers from the martian moon.>

This tantalizing stereo anaglyph view shows the Mars-facing side of Phobos.>

It highlights the asteroid-like moon's cratered and grooved surface.>

Up to hundreds of meters wide, the mysterious grooves may be related to the impact that created Stickney crater, the large crater at the left.>

Stickney crater is about 10 kilometers across, while Phobos itself is only around 27 kilometers across at its widest point.>
