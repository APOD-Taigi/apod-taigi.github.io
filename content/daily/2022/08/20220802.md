## [漢羅] A Moon Dressed Like Saturn
Why does Saturn appear so big?>

It doesn't -- what is pictured are foreground clouds on Earth crossing in front of the Moon.>

The Moon shows a slight crescent phase with most of its surface visible by reflected Earthlight known as ashen glow.>

The Sun directly illuminates the brightly lit lunar crescent from the bottom, which means that the Sun must be below the horizon and so the image was taken before sunrise.>

This double take-inducing picture was captured on 2019 December 24, two days before the Moon slid in front of the Sun to create a solar eclipse.>

In the foreground, lights from small Guatemalan towns are visible behind the huge volcano Pacaya.
