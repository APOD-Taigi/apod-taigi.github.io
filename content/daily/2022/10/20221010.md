## [English] A Double Lunar Analemma over Turkey
An [analemma][analemma] is that [figure-8][figure-8] curve you get when you mark the position of the Sun at the same time each day for one year.
But the trick to imaging an [analemma of the Moon][analemma of the Moon] is to wait bit longer.
On average the [Moon returns][Moon returns] to the same position in the sky about 50 minutes and 29 seconds later each day.
So [photograph the Moon][photograph the Moon e] 50 minutes 29 seconds later on successive days.
Over one lunation or lunar month it will trace out an analemma-like curve as the Moon's actual position wanders due to [its](https://www.fourmilab.ch/earthview/
moon_ap_per.html) tilted and [elliptical][elliptical] orbit.
Since the [featured image][featured image] was taken over two months, it actually shows a _double_ lunar analemma.
Crescent [lunar phases][lunar phases] too thin and faint to capture around the [New][New] moon [are missing][are missing].
The two months the persistent astrophotographer chose were during a good stretch of weather during July and August, and the location was [Kayseri][Kayseri], [Turkey][Turkey]
