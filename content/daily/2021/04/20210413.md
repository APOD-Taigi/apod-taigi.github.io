## [English] Confirmed Muon Wobble Remains Unexplained

How fast do [elementary particles][elementary particles] wobble? A [surprising answer][surprising answer] to this seemingly inconsequential question came out of [Brookhaven National Laboratory][Brookhaven National Laboratory] in [New York][New York], [USA][USA] in 2001, and indicated that the [Standard Model of Particle Physics][Standard Model of Particle Physics], adopted widely in physics, is incomplete. The result impllied that there are fundamental components of the [universe][universe] yet to be discovered. Specifically, the [muon][muon], a particle with similarities to a heavy [electron][electron], has had its relatively large wobble under scrutiny since 1999 in a series of experiments known as [g-2][g-2] (gee-minus-two). The Brookhaven result galvanized other experimental groups around the world to confirm it, and pressured theorists to [better understand][better understand] it. [Reporting][Reporting] in last week, the most sensitive muon wobble experiment yet, conducted at Fermi National Laboratory (Fermilab) in Illinois and [pictured here][pictured here], agreed with the Brookhaven result and again measured a slightly anomalous muon wobble. The [rate of wobble][rate of wobble] is sensitive to a strange sea of [virtual particles][virtual particles] that pop into and out of existence everywhere. The [unexpected wobble rate][unexpected wobble rate] may indicate that this sea includes [virtual particles][virtual particles] of a type beyond the Standard Model. Alternatively, it [may indicate][may indicate] that flaws exist in theoretical prediction calculations -- predictions that typically involve [supercomputers][supercomputers] and are [extremely complicated][extremely complicated]. Future runs at [Fermilab's g-2 experiment][Fermilab's g-2 experiment] will further [increase precision][increase precision] and, possibly, the statistical difference between the [universe we measure][universe we measure] and the [universe we understand][universe we understand].
