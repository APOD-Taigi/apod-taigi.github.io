## [漢羅] Stephan 五重奏
The first identified compact galaxy group, Stephan's Quintet is featured in this eye-catching image constructed with data drawn from the extensive Hubble Legacy Archive.>

About 300 million light-years away, only four of these five galaxies are actually locked in a cosmic dance of repeated close encounters.>

The odd man out is easy to spot, though.>

The interacting galaxies, NGC 7319, 7318A, 7318B, and 7317 have an overall yellowish cast.>

They also tend to have distorted loops and tails, grown under the influence of disruptive gravitational tides.>

But the predominantly bluish galaxy, NGC 7320, is closer, just 40 million light-years distant, and isn't part of the interacting group.>

Stephan's Quintet lies within the boundaries of the high flying constellation Pegasus.>

At the estimated distance of the quartet of interacting galaxies, this field of view spans about 500,000 light-years.>

But moving just beyond this field, up and to the right, astronomers can identify another galaxy, NGC 7320C, that is also 300 million light-years distant.>

Including it would bring the interacting quartet back up to quintet status.>
