## [漢羅] Planetary Alignment over Italy
It is not a coincidence that planets line up.>

That's because all of the planets orbit the Sun in (nearly) a single sheet called the plane of the ecliptic.>

When viewed from inside that plane -- as Earth dwellers are likely to do -- the planets all appear confined to a single band.>

It is a coincidence, though, when three of the brightest planets all appear in nearly the same direction.>

Such a coincidence was captured earlier this month.>

Featured above (right to left), Venus, Saturn, and Jupiter were all imaged together in a line just after sunset, from Chiuduno, Italy.>

Joining the alignment are Earth's Moon, and the position of the more distant Uranus.>

Bands of clouds streak across the sky toward the setting Sun.>

As Comet Leonard fades, this planetary alignment -- absent the Moon -- should persist for the rest of the month.>

## [English] Planetary Alignment over Italy
It is not a coincidence that planets line up.
That's because all of the [planets orbit][planets orbit] the [Sun][Sun] in (nearly) a single sheet called the plane of the [ecliptic][ecliptic].
When viewed from inside that plane -- as [Earth dwellers][Earth dwellers] are likely to do -- the planets all appear confined to a [single band][single band].
It is a coincidence, though, when [three of the brightest planets][three of the brightest planets] all appear in nearly the same direction.
Such a coincidence was captured earlier this month.
[Featured above][Featured above] (right to left), [Venus][Venus], [Saturn][Saturn e], and [Jupiter][Jupiter] were all [imaged together][imaged together] in a line just after sunset, from [Chiuduno][Chiuduno], [Italy][Italy].
Joining the alignment are [Earth's Moon][Earth's Moon], and the position of the more distant [Uranus][Uranus].
Bands of clouds streak across the sky toward the [setting Sun][setting Sun].
As [Comet Leonard][Comet Leonard e] fades, this planetary alignment -- absent the Moon -- should persist for the rest of the month.
